[Verse 1]
Look at me, I'm a beautiful feature
I don't care about your application meters
Welcome all, debug it quick, I will teach ya
Pam pam pa hoo, prram pam pa hoo
Hey, I think you forgot how to code
The application just will not load
It keeps on crashin' to say, hey, hey, hey
Hey! My "Error code" says "reason unknown"
I'm taking my laptop with me
My GIT repo has just now rejected me...

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey developer - whats wrong with your code ?
It doesn't compile and there's no debug mode ....
Its s a baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak-bak-mhm-bug
Baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak
The release is baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm...

[Chorus]
The release is broken, totally broken
Why hasn't anyone called or spoken ?
I'll recompile now, I'll push to the pipeline..
Gotta get this release out on time.
lousy release.... (cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)

[Verse 2]
A-A-A-Ani lo metafked
The code manifest is over my head
A-A-A-Ani lo metafked
Don't git merge - its gonna fail..
(Cululoo, cululoo) Alert sounds, sounding
(Cululoo, cululoo) Losing the contract, my heart is pounding
I don't care about your annual bonus ....
Pam pam pa hoo, prram pam pa hoo

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey developer - whats wrong with your code ?
It doesn't complile and and there's no debug mode ....
Its s a baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak-bak-mhm-bug
Baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bakbak
The release is baka-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm-bak-mhm...

[Chorus]
The release is broken, totally broken
Why hasn't anyone called or spoken ?
I'll recompile now, I'll push to the pipeline..
Gotta get this release out on time.

[Bridge]
I'll f-f-fix you now
Edit the nodejs script
Now, release

[Outro]
The release is broken, totally broken
Why hasn't anyone called or spoken ?
Hey, I think you forgot how to code
The application just will not load
I'm not a bug, look at me, I'm a beautiful feature
You stupid boy, I don't care about your modern-time preachers
The release is broken, totally broken, totally broken, totally broken, broken ....
The release is broken, totally broken, broken....
